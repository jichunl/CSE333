In addition, your code must:

compile without errors or warnings on CSE Linux machines (lab workstations, attu, or CSE home VM)
have no crashes, memory leaks, or memory errors on CSE linux machines
follow the style guidelines we've been using in class, including naming conventions for classes, methods, and instance variables. If in doubt, consult the Google C++ style guide (Google it to find it if you missed the link on the course web page). cpplint is also useful for suggesting things to check.
be pretty: the formatting, modularization, variable and function names, and so on must make us smile rather than cry.
have a comment at the top of the source file(s) with your name, student number, and CSE or UW email address.
